This is my Ruby-built Chess game!

The game is built using four ruby files, each for a Piece, Board, Display, and Cursor class. 

The game is playable through the terminal by running `ruby display.rb`. Press Enter to begin the game. 

Use the arrow keys to move the cursor.

Pressing Enter will highlight a piece and select it, select a legal destination square to complete the move. Select a square
with an opposite color piece to capture the piece. 

Two player and AI functionality coming soon. I hope you enjoy!
